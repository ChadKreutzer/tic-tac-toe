# Tic Tac Toe

Two player [Tic Tac Toe](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript-and-jquery/lessons/tic-tac-toe) game implemented in JavaScript.


This lesson is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) Come learn coding with a free and friendly community.

Required Features:

1. ~~Create a basic 3x3 board object in Javascript that lists the current item in each space on the board (e.g. "X", "O", or " ").~~
2. ~~Create a render() function which cycles through that board object and creates the appropriate HTML elements. Style them to look like a real tic-tac-toe board.~~
3. Build the main game logic (we won't give too many hints here). When the user clicks on a blank square, it should show the current player's symbol. This can be triggered by listening for a click event on the appropriate div. It may be helpful to give each div a data attribute or id based on its position so you can identify it in your JS code.~~
4. ~~The game logic should then check whether the game is over -- if any player has achieved victory or if there are no more turns available. In the event of victory or defeat, display an appropriate message on the screen.~~
5. *Optional* -- switch out the "X" and "O" letters with appropriate (or funny) images.
6. ~~Create a method for the game to ask to play again.~~
7. make it pretty.
8. refactor the code.
